Overview
--------

This cookiecutter can be used to generate `xeus-based <https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus>`_ `Jupyter kernels <https://jupyter.org/>`_.
This cookiecutter has been used to generate `xeus-lua <https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-lua>`_ and `xeus-wren <https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-wren>`_.

Features
--------

* Unit Tests:
    * Kernel is tested via `jupyter-kernel-tests <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_kernel_test>`_.
* Continuous Integration with Github Actions:
    * Tests run on ubuntu, mac, win and emscripten
    * Fast installation of dependencies via `micromamba <https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba>`_
* Documentation:
    * Ready to use `sphinx-based <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ included.
    * Compatible to run on `readthedocs <readthedocs.org>`_.
* Modern CMake
* WASM build: 
    * Includes a wasm target which can be used to build a `jupyterlite-kernel <https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/>`_ for your kernel similar to `jupyterlite xeus-lua <https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus-lua-kernel>`_.

Usage
-----


Install the cookiecutter package with conda

.. code-block:: bash
    
    conda install cookiecutter -c conda-forge

or pip

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install cookiecutter

Once cookiecutter is available on your system, run the xeus-cookiecutter:

.. code-block:: bash
